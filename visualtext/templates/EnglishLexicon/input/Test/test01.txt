LONDON (Reuters) - Biotech firm PowderJect Pharmaceuticals Plc said on Tuesday
that studies on a vaccine against HIV had shown that the drug, when delivered by the
PowderJect system, might protect against every infection.

The company said two studies had demonstrated important advances in the
development of a DNA vaccine to combat HIV.

"The studies, carried out in a widely accepted laboratory model for HIV, demonstrate
that DNA vaccination via the PowderJect System results in an unprecedentedly high
cellular immune response, and additionally indicate that this type of response may
protect against infection," PowderJect said.

The human immunodeficiency virus causes the deadly disease AIDS.
