<h1>About Text Analysis International</h1>

<p>The mission of Text Analysis International (TAI) is to revolutionize 
 the way in which people process text.</p>

<p>TAI was founded in 1998 to develop technologies to analyze text deeply, 
 accurately, and extensibly. VisualText embodies that technological approach, 
 enabling a Natural Language Engineering (NLE) methodology for developing 
 text analyzers. With NLE, the user controls the order of execution, the 
 contexts to be worked in, and the actions to be taken in every step of 
 the analysis of a text.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">TAI's goals include an ever-greater degree 
 of automation in the analysis of text, but always with a pragmatic, rather 
 than theoretical, foundation. TAI is developing standardized bodies of 
 knowledge, methods for text analysis, and diverse applications as it broadens 
 its core technology. Rather than championing any particular paradigm, 
 TAI seeks to exploit all paradigms and methods and to integrate methods 
 wherever useful. Rather than over-committing to keyword, statistical, 
 neural network, pattern, recursive grammar, or other approaches, TAI seeks 
 to encompass all these approaches and more within its product sets.</p>
